# Simple shopping cart web site with JS (Mickey Shopping)  - 2023

## About this project
The website is a simple shopping website with a shopping cart feature that allows users to increase or decrease the quantity of their chosen products using buttons. Once users have selected their desired products and quantities, they can proceed to the "Order Now" button to go to the service page. On the service page, users can confirm their order by clicking the "Confirm Order" button.

Additionally, the website provides a contact page where users can submit their valuable comments along with their name and email address. It's important to note that this website is a practice project designed for learning JavaScript and does not serve real-life purposes.
